===============
Test RST to Man
===============

Just a test of creating manpages using reStructuredText_. After running
``build.sh``, you can read it with ``man ./foo.69``.


Requirements
============

#. ``rst2man``

   - On Gentoo, this is ``rst2man.py`` from ``dev-python/docutils``. I will
     assume you're a cool cat and have it installed as ``rst2man.py``.


.. _reStructuredText:
    https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html
