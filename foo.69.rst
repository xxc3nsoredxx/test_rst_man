Synopsis
========

.. TODO:
    - is there a better way to denote *file* and such?

| ``foo`` [options_] *file*
| ``foo exterminate`` *file*
| ``foo annihilate`` *file*
| ``foo destroy`` *file*


Description
===========

``foo`` is a lovely tool for taking proper care of your files. And quite
friendly.

.. IMPORTANT::
    Don't be intimidated -- the System loves you!


Options
=======

There are not many options, but here they are anyway. For the people too lazy to
read the go*damn fucki*g source code...


General options
---------------

-a, --ask
    Pretends to ask before doing the thing anyway.

-f, --force
    Tell ``foo`` that you want it to do the thing, despite it being potentially
    dangerous. (Little do you know, it would do it anyway)


Cool options
------------

--science-bitch
    Does the Science (TM), and is proud of it too.

--why-dont-you-take-this-key-and-shove-it-up-your-ass-sideways
    Jump starts your RV, skipping the arduous process of creating a battery
    using Chemicals (TM).


Files
=====

/dev/urandom
    Used by ``foo`` when it needs to compare *file* with an existing, known-good
    one.


Bugs
====

There are many ;)
